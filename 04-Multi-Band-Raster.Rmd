#About Raster Bands

As discussed in the [Intro to Raster Data Lesson 00]( {{ base.url }} }}NEON-R-Spatial-Raster/R/Introduction-to-Raster-Data-In-R), a raster can
contain 1 or more bands.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/single_multi_raster.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/single_multi_raster.png"></a>
    <figcaption>A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the raster 
    function to import one single band from a single OR multi-band raster.</figcaption>
</figure>

To work with multi-band rasters, we need to change how 
we import and plot our data in several ways. 

* To import multi band raster data we will use the `stack()` function.
* If our multi-band data are imagery that we wish to composite, we can use
`plotRGB()` (instead of `plot`) to plot a 3 band raster image.

Want to learn more? The video below, covers the basics of what a multi-band 
images are:

To work with multi-band rasters, we will use the `raster` and `rgdal` libraries.

```{r load-libraries }
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

```

#About Multi-Band Imagery
A raster dataset can store multiple bands. One type of multi-band raster dataset 
that is familiar to many of us is a color image. A basic color image consists of 
three bands: red, green, and blue. The pixel brightness for each band, when 
composited creates the colors that we see in an image. 

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/RGBSTack_1.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/RGBSTack_1.png"></a>
    <figcaption>A color image consists of 3 bands - red, green and blue. When
    rendered together in a GIS, or even a tool like Photoshop or any other
    image software, they create a color image.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can plot each band of a multi-band image individually. 

> Note: In many GIS applications, a single band would render as a single
> image band using a grayscale color palette. We will thus use a grayscale 
> palette to render individual bands.

```{r demonstrate-RGB-Image, echo=FALSE}
# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack_HARV <- stack("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

names(RGB_stack_HARV) <- c("Red.Band","Green.Band","Blue.Band")

grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100, 
                                start = 0.0, 
                                end = 1.0, 
                                gamma = 2.2, 
                                alpha = NULL)

# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plot(RGB_stack_HARV, col=grayscale_colors)

```

Or we can composite all three bands together to make a color image.

```{r plot-RGB-now, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE }
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack

original_par <-par() #original par
par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes=TRUE, 
        main="3 Band Color Composite Image")
box(col="white")

```

```{r reset-par, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
#making sure this doesn't render in the lesson
par(original_par) # go back to original par

```


#Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. Time series: same variable, over the same area, over time. 
[Check out Lesson 04 - Raster time series data in R to learn more about time series stacks]({{ site.baseurl}}/R/Raster-Times-Series-Data-In-R/).
2. Multi-hyperspectral imagery: that might have 4 or more bands up to 400+ bands 
of image data! Check out a lesson on 
<a href="http://neondataskills.org/HDF5/Imaging-Spectroscopy-HDF5-In-R/" target="_blank">
hyperspectral imagery here.</a>

NOTE: In a multi-band dataset, the rasters will always have the same extent,
CRS and resolution.
{: .notice }

In this lesson, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery
collected using the <a href="http://http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/collection-methods/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank">NEON Airborne Observation Platform</a> high resolution camera over
the <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>. 
Each RGB images is a 3-band raster. However the same steps would apply to working
with a multi-spectral image that might have 4 or more bands - like Landsat.

#Getting Started with Multi-Band Data
If we read a `rasterStack` into R using the `raster` function, it defaults to 
reading in just the first band. We can plot this band using the plot function. 

```{r read-single-band }
 
# Read in multi-band raster with raster function. 
#Default is the first band only.
RGB_band1_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

#create a grayscale color palette to use for the image.
grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100,            #how many different color levels 
                                start = 0.0,    #how black (0) to go
                                end = 1.0,      #how white (1) to go
                                gamma = 2.2,    #correction between how a digital
                                #camera sees the world and how human eyes see it
                                alpha = NULL)   #Null=colors are not transparent

#Plot band 1
plot(RGB_band1_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors, 
     main="NEON RGB Imagery - Band 1\nHarvard Forest") 

#view attributes: Check out dimension, CRS, resolution, values attributes, and 
#band.
RGB_band1_HARV
```

Note that when we look at the attributes of RGB_Band1, we see :

`band: 1  (of  3  bands)`

This is `R` telling us that this particular raster object has more bands
associated with it!

NOTE: The number of bands associated with a raster object can also be
determined using the `nbands` slot. Syntax is `ObjectName@file@nbands`, or
specifically for our file: `RGB_band1@file@nbands`.
{ : .notice }

##Raster Data Values for Images
Take careful note of the min and max values of our raster - What do you see?

```{r min-max-image }
#view min value
minValue(RGB_band1_HARV)

#view max value
maxValue(RGB_band1_HARV)
```

In this raster image, we see values between 0 and 255 are used. These values 
represent degrees of brightness associated with the band color being viewed. In 
the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. Thus when 
you plot that band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with more red 
in them. Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent pixels with less red in them. To 
plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values into one single color.

##Import A Specific Band
We can use the raster function to import specific bands in our raster object by
specifying which band we want with `band=N` where N is the number of the band
that you want to work with. If we want to import the green band we would use 
`band=2`.

```{r read-specific-band }
# Can specify which band you want to read in
RGB_band2_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif", 
                    band = 2)

#plot band 2
plot(RGB_band2_HARV,
     col=grayscale_colors,   #we already created this palatte & can use it again
     main="NEON RGB Imagery - Band 2\nHarvard Forest")

#view attributes of band 2 
RGB_band2_HARV

```

Notice that band 2 is band 2 of 3 bands.
`band: 2  (of  3  bands)`


> #Challenge: Making sense of single band images
> If you compare the plots of band 1 (red) and band 2 (green) you can see subtle 
> differences in the image. The forest appears paler in band 2 (green). Why?  

Next, we will explore working with all 3 bands - using a `RasterStack`. 

```{r challenge1-answer, echo=FALSE }

#We'd expect a *brighter* value for the forest in band 2 (green) than in 
#band 1 (red) because most trees appear green. 

```

#Raster Stacks in R
We have now explored individual bands in a multi-band raster. Let's bring in all
3 bands of our 3-band image composite it to create a final color RGB plot in `R`. 

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`stack()` function.

```{r intro-to-raster-stacks }

# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack_HARV <- stack("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

#view attributes of stack object
RGB_stack_HARV

```

To further explore the rasters, we can use `RGB_stack_HARV@layers` to get a 
band-by-band view of the attributes of all bands in the raster object in `R` or 
specify which band we want to see attributes for.  We can also use the `plot()` 
and `hist()` functions on the `RasterStack` to view each band in the stack.

```{r plot-raster-layers}

#view raster attributes
RGB_stack_HARV@layers

#view attributes for one band
RGB_stack_HARV[[1]]

#view histogram of all 3 bands
hist(RGB_stack_HARV,
     maxpixels=ncell(RGB_stack_HARV))

#plot one band
plot(RGB_stack_HARV[[1]], 
     main="RGB_stack Band 1", 
     col=grayscale_colors)

#plot all three bands separately
plot(RGB_stack_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors)

# revert to a single plot layout 
#par(mfrow=c(1,1)) 

```


#Create A Three Band Image
To render a final 3 band, color image in `R`, we use `plotRGB()`.

This function allows us to also:

1. Determine what order we want to plot the bands.  RGB assumes that the bands 
are 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue.  However, bands may not be in that order or bands
may be of data that is outside the visible human range yet we want to plot them 
in RGB so that we can visualize it. 

2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to make it brighter or darker. Adjusting 
the stretch can help us adjust the contrast in our image.

Let's plot our image.

```{r plot-rgb-image }

# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV, 
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)



```

The image above looks pretty good. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using  `stretch="lin"` or 
`stretch="hist"`.  

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/imageStretch_dark.jpg">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/imageStretch_dark.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a darker
    image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 
    0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/imageStretch_light.jpg">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/raster_timeseries/imageStretch_light.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a lighter
    image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to the full 
    0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>


```{r image-stretch }

#what does stretch do?
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, 
        scale=800,
        stretch = "lin")

```


In this case, the stretch doesn't improve the clarity of our image significantly.
However sometimes it can be useful if the image contrast is low when first plotted.


##Challenge - NoData Values
To explore what happens with NoData values when using `RasterStack` and `plotRGB`
we will explore the `HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` GeoTIFF in the `NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV`
directory.

1. View the files attributes. Are there `NoData` values assigned for this file? 
2. If so, what is the `NoData` Value? 
3. How many bands does it have?
4. Open the multi-band raster file in `R`. 
5. Plot the object as a true color image. 
6. What happened to the black edges in the data?
7. What does this tell us about the difference in the data structure between  
`HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` and `HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif` (`R` object RGB_stack). How can you
check?

Answer the questions above using the functions we have covered so far in this
lesson.

``` {r challenge-code-NoData, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
#1.
#view attributes
GDALinfo("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif")

#2 Yes it has NoData values as they are assigned as -9999 
#3 3 bands

#4
#reading in file
HARV_NA<- stack("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif")

#5
plotRGB(HARV_NA, 
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)

#6 The black edges are not plotted. 
#7 Both have NoData values, however, in RGB_stack they are a number that R #doesn't recognize as a NoData value and therefore doesn't conver it to NA. 
GDALinfo("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

```

> Bonus: So far we've created a RasterStack from multiple bands in one GeoTIFF, 
> however, you can also create a RasterStack by combining single bands from

##RasterStack vs RasterBrick in R

Both `RasterStack` and `RasterBrick` are `R` objects with multiple bands. The bands 
in a `RasterStack` are stored anywhere on your computer. A 
`RasterBrick` contains all of the objects stored within the actual R object. In 
most cases, you can work with a `RasterBrick` in the same way you might work
with a `RasterStack`. However a `RasterBrick` is often more efficient and faster
to process - which is important when working with larger files.

<a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/raster/docs/brick" target="_blank">More on Raster Bricks</a>

You can turn a `RasterStack` into a `RasterBrick` in `R` by using
`brick(StackName)`. Let's use the `object.size()` function to compare `stack` 
and `brick` `R` objects.

```{r raster-bricks }

#view size of the RGB_stack object that contains our 3 band image
object.size(RGB_stack_HARV)

#convert stack to a brick
RGB_brick_HARV <- brick(RGB_stack_HARV)

#view size of the brick
object.size(RGB_brick_HARV)

```

All the bands are stored within the `RasterBrick` object. Thus the object size
is much larger for a `RasterBrick` than for a `RasterStack`. 

PlotRGB can still be used for plotting bricks.

``` {r plot-brick}
#plot brick
plotRGB(RGB_brick_HARV)

```


> #Challenge: What Methods Can I Use on an Object?
> You can view various methods available to call on an `R` object with 
> `methods(class=class(objectNameHere))`. Use this to figure out:
>
> 1) What methods can you use to call on the `RGB_stack_HARV` object? 
> 2) What methods are available for a single band within `RGB_stack_HARV`? 
> 3) Why do you think there is a difference? 

``` {r challenge-code-calling-methods, echo=FALSE}
#1
#methods for calling a stack
methods(class=class(RGB_stack_HARV))
# 143 methods!

#2
#methods for calling a band (1) with a stack
methods(class=class(RGB_stack_HARV[1]))

#3 There are far more thing one could or wants to ask of a full stack than of 
#a single band.  
```
