In this episode, we will review the fundamental principles, packages and
metadata/raster attributes that are needed to work with raster data in `R`.
We discuss the three core metadata elements that we need to understand to work
with rasters in `R`: **CRS**, **extent** and **resolution**. It also explores
missing and bad data values as stored in a raster and how `R` handles these
elements. Finally, it introduces the GeoTiff file format.

## Raster Data in R

Let's first import a raster dataset into `R` and explore its metadata.
To open rasters in `R`, we will use the `raster` and `rgdal` packages. Make sure that you have these libraries loaded.

```{r load-libraries-2, eval=FALSE}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

## Open a Raster in R
We can use the `raster("path-to-raster-here")` function to open a raster in R.

> ## Data Tip
> OBJECT NAMES! To improve code
> readability, file and object names should be used that make it clear what is in
> the file. The data for this episode were collected over from Harvard Forest so
> we'll use a naming convention of `datatype_HARV`.

```{r}
# Load raster into R
DSM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

# View raster structure
DSM_HARV
```

```{r}
# convert to a df for plotting in two steps,
# First, to a SpatialPointsDataFrame
DSM_HARV_df <- rasterToPoints(DSM_HARV, spatial = TRUE) %>%
# Then to a 'conventional' dataframe
    data.frame()

# View dataframe structure
str(DSM_HARV_df)
```

```{r, fig.width= 7, fig.height=7}
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
    coord_equal()

```

Here is a map showing the elevation of our site in Harvard Forest. Is the max
elevation value within this raster greater than 400 meters or 400 feet? Perhaps
we need to learn more about the data attributes from the metadata!

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in R
We can view the `CRS` string associated with our `R` object using the`crs()`
function. We can assign this string to an `R` object, too.

```{r view-resolution-units}
# view resolution units
crs(DSM_HARV)

# assign crs to an object (class) to use for reprojection and other tasks
myCRS <- crs(DSM_HARV)
myCRS

```

The `CRS` of our `DSM_HARV` object tells us that our data are in the universal transverse mercator (UTM) projection.

</figure>

The CRS in this case is in a `PROJ 4` format. This means that the projection
information is strung together as a series of text elements, each of which
begins with a `+` sign.

 `+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

We'll focus on the first few components of the CRS in this episode.

* `+proj=utm` The projection of the dataset. Our data are in Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM).
* `+zone=18` The UTM projection divides up the world into zones, this element
tells you which zone the data is in. Harvard Forest is in Zone 18.
* `+datum=WGS84` The datum was used to define the center point of the
projection. Our raster uses the `WGS84` datum.
* `+units=m` This is the horizontal units that the data are in. Our units
are meters.

## Calculate Raster Min and Max Values

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In
this case, given we are working with elevation data, these values represent the
min/max elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a `geotiff` for us.
However if they weren't already calculated, we can calculate them using the
`setMinMax()` function.

```{r set-min-max }

# This is the code if min/max weren't calculated:
# DSM_HARV <- setMinMax(DSM_HARV)

# view the calculated min value
minValue(DSM_HARV)

# view only max value
maxValue(DSM_HARV)

```

We can see that the elevation at our site ranges from 305.07m to 416.07m.

## NoData Values in Rasters

Raster data often has a `NoDataValue` associated with it. This is a value
assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected.

By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we
have  a dataset that has a shape that isn't rectangular, some pixels
at the edge of the raster will have `NoDataValue`s. This often happens when the
data were collected by an airplane which only flew over some part of a defined
region.

In the image below, the pixels that are black have `NoDataValue`s.
The camera did not collect data in these areas.


```{r demonstrate-no-data-black-ggplot, echo=FALSE }
# no data demonstration code - not being taught
# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack <-
  stack("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

# convert to a df for plotting in two steps,
# First, to a SpatialPointsDataFrame
RGB_pts <- rasterToPoints(RGB_stack, spatial = TRUE)
# Then to a 'conventional' dataframe
RGB_df  <- data.frame(RGB_pts)
# save some memory and remove the pts object
rm(RGB_pts)

ggplot() +
 geom_raster(data = RGB_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_RGB_Ortho.1),
             show.legend = FALSE)

# more memory saving
rm(RGB_df)
```

In the next image, the black edges have been assigned `NoDataValue`. `R` doesn't render pixels that contain a specified `NoDataValue`. `R` assigns missing data with the `NoDataValue` as `NA`.

```{r demonstrate-no-data-ggplot, echo=FALSE}
# reassign cells with 0,0,0 to NA
# this is simply demonstration code - we will not teach this.
f <- function(x) {
  x[rowSums(x == 0) == 3, ] <- NA
  x
  }

newRGBImage <- calc(RGB_stack, f)
newRGB_pts <- rasterToPoints(newRGBImage, spatial = TRUE)
# Then to a 'conventional' dataframe
newRGB_df  <- data.frame(newRGB_pts)
# memory save
rm(newRGB_pts)

ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = newRGB_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_RGB_Ortho.1), 
             show.legend = FALSE)
#memory saving
rm(newRGB_df)
```

### NoData Value Standard

The assigned `NoDataValue` varies across disciplines; `-9999` is a common value
used in both the remote sensing field and the atmospheric fields. It is also
the standard used by the <a href="http://www.neonscience.org" target="_blank">
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)</a>.

If we are lucky, our GeoTIFF file has a tag that tells us what is the
`NoDataValue`. If we are less lucky, we can find that information in the
raster's metadata. If a `NoDataValue` was stored in the GeoTIFF tag, when `R`
opens up the raster, it will assign each instance of the value to `NA`. Values
of `NA` will be ignored by `R` as demonstrated above.

## Bad Data Values in Rasters

Bad data values are different from `NoDataValue`s. Bad data values are values
that fall outside of the applicable range of a dataset.

Examples of Bad Data Values:

* The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a measure of
greenness, has a valid range of -1 to 1. Any value outside of that range would
be considered a "bad" or miscalculated value.
* Reflectance data in an image will often range from 0-1 or 0-10,000 depending
upon how the data are scaled. Thus a value greater than 1 or greater than 10,000
is likely caused by an error in either data collection or processing.

### Find Bad Data Values
Sometimes a raster's metadata will tell us the range of expected values for a
raster. Values outside of this range are suspect and we need to consider than
when we analyze the data. Sometimes, we need to use some common sense and
scientific insight as we examine the data - just as we would for field data to
identify questionable values.

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the
`geom_histogram()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often useful in
identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.

```{r view-raster-histogram }

ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(HARV_dsmCrop))

```

Notice that an warning message is thrown when `R` creates the histogram.

`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

This warning is caused by `ggplot`'s default settings enforcing that there are 30 bins for the data.
We can define the number of bins we want in the histogram by using the `bins` value in the 
`geom_histogram()` function.


``` {r view-raster-histogram2}

ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(HARV_dsmCrop), bins = 40)

```

Note that the shape of both histograms looks similar to the previous one that
 was created using the default of 30 bins. The
distribution of elevation values for our `Digital Surface Model (DSM)` looks
reasonable. It is likely there are no bad data values in this particular raster.

## Raster Bands
The Digital Surface Model object (`DSM_HARV`) that we've been working with
is a single band raster. This means that there is only one dataset stored in
the raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period.

<figure>

    <img src="../images/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
    </figcaption>
</figure>

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `raster()` function
to import one single band from a single OR multi-band raster. We can view the number
of bands in a raster using the `nlayers()` function.

```{r view-raster-bands }

# view number of bands
nlayers(DSM_HARV)

```

However, raster data can also be multi-band meaning that one raster file
contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. By
default the `raster()` function only imports the first band in a raster
regardless of whether it has one or more bands. Jump to the fourth episode in
this series for a episode on multi-band rasters:

## View Raster File Attributes

Remember that a `GeoTIFF` contains a set of embedded tags that contain
metadata about the raster. So far, we've explored raster metadata **after**
importing it in `R`. However, we can use the `GDALinfo("path-to-raster-here")`
function to view raster metadata before we open a file in `R`.

```{r view-attributes-gdal}

# view attributes before opening file
GDALinfo("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

```

Notice a few things in the output:

1. A projection is described using a string in the `proj4` format :
`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs `
2. We can identify a `NoDataValue`: -9999
3. We can tell how many `bands` the file contains: 1
4. We can view the x and y `resolution` of the data: 1
5. We can see the min and max values of the data: `Bmin` and `Bmax`.

It is ideal to use `GDALinfo` to explore your file **before** reading it into
`R`.
