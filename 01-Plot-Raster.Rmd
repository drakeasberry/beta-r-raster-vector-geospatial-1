##About
This post explains the simple plotting function in the `raster` package.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives">

<h3>Goals / Objectives</h3>
After completing this activity, you will know:
<ol>
<li>how to plot a single raster image.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Things You'll Need To Complete This Lesson</h3>

<h3>R Libraries to Install:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>raster:</strong> <code> install.packages("raster")</code></li>
<li><strong>rgdal:</strong> <code> install.packages("rgdal")</code></li>

</ul>
<h4>Tools To Install</h4>

Please be sure you have the most current version of `R` and preferably
R studio to write your code.


<h4>Data to Download</h4>

Download the workshop data:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/NEON_AOP_Hyperspectral_Teaching_Dataset_SJER_and_Harvard_forest/1580086" class="btn btn-success"> DOWNLOAD Sample NEON LiDAR data in Raster Format & Vegetation Sampling Data</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The LiDAR and imagery data used to create the rasters in this dataset were 
collected over the Harvard and San Joaquin field sites 
and processed at <a href="http://www.neoninc.org" target="_blank" >NEON </a> 
headquarters. The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the NEON website.</p>

##Plotting raster files
We should already be familiar with the DSM Harvard raster file because it has been
opened in the first raster lesson, Raster Structure. We will now plot this raster and the histogram of the raster values to get an idea of what the raster is like.  

```
#Plot entire raster
plot(DSM)

#Plot distribution of raster values, get an error cause only plots subset
hist(DSM)
pixels = ncol(DSM) * nrow(DSM)
hist(DSM, maxpixels = pixels)
```

We can also use some arguments for the plot function to plot a subset of the raster values or choose which values correspond to which plot colors. 

```
#Plot a subset of the pixel values, e.g., the bottom 50m of surface
plot(DSM, zlim = c(305, 355))

#Plot all pixel values using broader categories for values
myCol = terrain.colors(4)
plot(DSM, breaks = c(305, 341, 377, 416), col = myCol, maxpixels = pixels)
```

Lastly, like most plots, we can add labels
```
#Add axes and title to raster plot
plot(DSM, xlab = "X Coordinates", ylab = "Y Coordinates", main = "Harvard Forest Digital Surface Model")
```

##Challenge

Create a plot of the Harvard DSM that has a legend with six colors that are evenly divided amongst the range of pixel values.
