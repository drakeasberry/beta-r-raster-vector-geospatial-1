##About
When dealing with spatial data, we often want to perform calculaions on rasters 
or combine multiple rasters to create a new output raster. This lesson will 
cover some of the most common functions to modify rasters including `overlay`,
`calc` and raster math.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

#Raster Calculations in R
We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new 
output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of trees
across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the *difference* between
the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the 
Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to 
as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees, 
buildings, etc with the influence of ground elevation removed.

More on LiDAR CHM, DTM and DSM in this NEON Data Skills overview: <a href="http://neondataskills.org/remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/" target="_blank"> What is a CHM, DSM and DTM? About Gridded, Raster LiDAR Data</a>. {: .notice2}

###Load the Data 

```{r load-libraries }
#load raster package
library(raster)

#view info about the dtm & dsm raster data
GDALinfo("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
GDALinfo("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

```

Both rasters are in the same CRS, have the same resolution and mins/maxes are
already in the tags. Let's load the data. 

``` {r load-plot-data}
#load the DTM & DSM rasters
DTM_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
DSM_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

#create a quick plot of each to see what we're dealing with
plot(DTM_HARV,
     main="Digital Terrain Model (Elevation)\n Harvard Forest")

plot(DSM_HARV,
     main="Digital Surface Model (Elevation)\n Harvard Forest")
```

Notice that the elevation range for these two maps (DSM and DTM) is different. 
Why?  Should we be worried about this?  

##Two Ways to Calculate
We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

1. by directly subtracting the two rasters in `R` using raster math

or if our rasters are large and/or the calculations we are performing are 
complex:

2. using the `overlay()` function.

##Raster Math & Canopy Height Models
First, we'll learn the intuitive process of subtracting layers to create and
plot a CHM.  In the geospatial world we often call this *raster math*.

Once the data are loaded, we can perform mathametical operations on them.
For instance, we can subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height
Model.

```{r raster-math }
# Raster math example
CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV 

#plot the output CHM
plot(CHM_HARV,
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Manual Subtract\n Harvard Forest") 

```

Let's have a quick look at the range of values in our newly created Canopy
Height Model (CHM).

```{r create-hist }
#histogram of CHM_HARV
hist(CHM_HARV,
     col="springgreen4",
     main="Histogram of NEON Canopy Height Model\nHarvard Forest",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Tree Height (m) ")

```

Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 meters.
Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

#Challenge: Exploring Raster Values in CHM
It's often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just
like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.  

1. What is the min and maximum value for the Harvard Forest Canopy 
Height Model (`CHM_HARV`) that we just created?
2. What are two ways you can check this range of data in `CHM_HARV`? 
3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM? 
4. Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color of
the histogram. 
5. Plot the `CHM_HARV` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. Include
a appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes. 

```{r challenge-code-CHM-HARV,  include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE} 
#1) 
minValue(CHM_HARV)
maxValue(CHM_HARV)
#2) Looks at histogram, minValue(NAME)/maxValue(NAME), NAME and look at values slot. 
#3
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     col="springgreen4",
     main = "Histogram of NEON Canopy Height Model\n Harvard Forest",
     maxpixels=ncell(CHM_HARV))
#4 
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     col="lightgreen",
     main = "Histogram of NEON Canopy Height Model\n Harvard Forest",
     maxpixels=ncell(CHM_HARV),
     breaks=6)
#5
myCol=terrain.colors(4)
plot(CHM_HARV,
     breaks=c(0,10,20,30),
     col=myCol,
     axes=F,
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model \nHarvard Forest")

```

Next, we will perform the same calculations using a more efficient aproach - the
`overlay()` function. 

#Efficient Raster Calculations: Overlay Function
Basic raster math, like we just did, is an appropriate approach to a calculation
if

1. The rasters we are using are small in size.
2. The calculations we are performing are simple.

Raster math is intuitive and easy to code, however it is a less efficient
approach as computation becomes more complex or as file sizes become large. 
The `overlay()` function is more efficient when

1. The rasters we are using are larger in size. 
2. The rasters are stored as individual files. 
3. The computations performed are complex. 

The `overlay()` function takes two or more rasters and applies a function to
them using efficient processing methods. The syntax is

`outputRaster <- overlay(raster1, raster2, fun=functionName)`

NOTE: If the rasters are stacked and stored as `RasterStack` or `RasterBrick`
objects in `R`, then we should use `calc()`. `overlay()` will not work on
stacked rasters. 
{: .notice2}

Let's perform the same calculation between the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using the `overlay()` function.  

```{r raster-overlay }
CHM_ov_HARV<- overlay(DSM_HARV,
                      DTM_HARV,
                      fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

plot(CHM_ov_HARV,
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n Harvard Forest")
```

How do the plots of the CHM created with manual raster math and the `overlay()`
function compare?  

A quick note on functions: A function consists of a define set of tasks 
performed on a input object. Functions are particularly useful for tasks that
need to be repeated over and over in the code. A simplified syntax for a
function in R is:
 `functionName <- function(variable1, variable2){WhatYouWantDone, WhatToReturn}`
 {: .notice2}

#Writing Raster Files
Now that we've created a new raster, let's export the data as a `geotiff`  using
the `writeRaster` function. 

When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we'll name it 
`chm_HARV.tiff` this way we know that it is a canopy height model of Harvard 
Forest. The `writeRaster()` function by default writes the output file to your 
working directory unless you specify a full file path.

```{r write-raster }
#export CHM object to new GeotIFF
writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "chm_HARV.tiff",
            format="GTiff",  #specify output format - geotiff
            overwrite=TRUE, #CAUTION if this is true, it will overwrite an existing file
            NAflag=-9999) #set no data value to -9999

```

In the code we specify that the format will be GTiff. Overwrite is true so that
it replaces any other file with this name. This is a useful setting so that you
can make a change to the object and then update the file by re-runing the code.
However, be careful to never accidentally re-use a name for a file that already 
exists. We are setting the NA value to -9999, the National Ecological
Observatory Network's (NEON) standard `NoData` value. 

# Challenge: Explore the NEON San Joaquin (SJER) Field Site

As ecologists we may want to explore the phenology of two different sites.  The 
 <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/san-joaquin-experimental-range" target="_blank" >NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) field site </a> located in Southern California is very different ecosystem and climate compared to the 
  <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank" >NEON Harvard Forest Field Site</a> in 
 Massachusetts.  

Import the San Joaquin DSM and DTM raster files and create a Canopy Height Model.
 Then compare the two sites. BE sure to name your R objects and outputs carefully,
 as follows: objectType_SJER (e.g. `DSM_SJER`). This will help you keep track of  data from different sites!

1. Import the DSM and DTM from the SJER directory (If you didn't aready import
them in the [Plot Raster Data in R]({{ site.baseurl}}/R/Plot-Rasters-In-R/)
lesson.) Don't forget to examine the data for CRS, bad values, etc. 
 2. Create a CHM from the two raster layers and check to make sure the data are 
what you expect. 
3. Plot the CHM from SJER. 
4. Export the SJER CHM as a GeoTIFF.
5. Compare the vegetation structure of the Harvard Forest and San Joaquin 
Experiemental Range.
Hint: plotting SJER and HARV data side-by-side would be an effective way to see 
the data at the same time.

```{r challenge-code-SJER-CHM,include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
#1.
#load the DTM
DTM_SJER <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/SJER/DTM/SJER_dtmCrop.tif")
#load the DSM
DSM_SJER <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/SJER/DSM/SJER_dsmCrop.tif")

#check CRS, units, etc
DTM_SJER
DSM_SJER

#check values
hist(DTM_SJER, 
     maxpixels=ncell(DTM_SJER),
     main="NEON Digital Terrain Model - Histogram\n SJER",
     col="slategrey",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")
hist(DSM_SJER, 
     maxpixels=ncell(DSM_SJER),
     main="NEON Digital Surface Model - Histogram\n SJER",
     col="slategray2",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

#2.
#use overlay to subtract the two rasters & create CHM
CHM_SJER <- overlay(DSM_SJER,DTM_SJER,
                    fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

hist(CHM_SJER, 
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Histogram\n SJER",
     col="springgreen4",
     ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

#3
#plot the output
plot(CHM_SJER,
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n SJER",
     axes=F)

#4 
#Write to object to file
writeRaster(CHM_SJER,"chm_ov_SJER.tiff",
            format="GTiff", 
            overwrite=TRUE, 
            NAflag=-9999)

#4.Tree heights are WAY shorter in SJER. 
#view histogram of HARV again. 
par(mfcol=c(2,1))
hist(CHM_HARV, 
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Histogram\n Harvard Forest",
     col="springgreen4",
      ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")

hist(CHM_SJER, 
     main="NEON Canopy Height Model - Histogram\n San Joachin Experimental Range",
     col="slategrey", ylab="Number of Pixels",
     xlab="Elevation (m)")


```

What do these two histograms tell us about the vegetation structure at Harvard 
and SJER?
