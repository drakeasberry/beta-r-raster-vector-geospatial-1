## About
This tutorial explains what shapefile attributes are and how to work with 
shapefile attributes in `R`. It also covers how to identify and query shapefile
attributes, as well as subset shapefiles by specific attribute values. 
Finally, we will review how to plot a shapefile according to a set of attribute 
values.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes
When we import a shapefile into `R`, the `readOGR()` function automatically
stores metadata and attributes associated with the file.

## Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `rgdal` library. The `raster` 
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
raster and vector files. 

We will import three shapefiles. The first is our `AOI` or area of
interest boundary polygon that we worked with in 
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/). 
The second is a shapefile containing the location of roads and trails within the
field site. The third is a file containing the Fisher tower location.

If you completed the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/) 
tutorial, you can skip this code.


```r
# load packages
# rgdal: for vector work; sp package should always load with rgdal. 
library(rgdal)  
# raster: for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library (raster)   

# set working directory to data folder
# setwd("pathToDirHere")

# Import a polygon shapefile 
aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/",
                            "HarClip_UTMZ18")
```

```
## Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv, : Cannot open data source

```

```
## Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv, : Cannot open data source
```

## Query Shapefile Metadata 
Remember, as covered in 
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/),
we can view metadata associated with an `R` object using:

* `class()` - Describes the type of vector data stored in the object.
* `length()` - How many features are in this spatial object?
* object `extent()` - The spatial extent (geographic area covered by) features 
in the object.
* coordinate reference system (`crs()`) - The spatial projection that the data are
in. 

Let's explore the metadata for our `point_HARV` object. 


```r
# view class
class(x = point_HARV)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```r
# x= isn't actually needed; it just specifies which object
# view features count
length(point_HARV)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```r
# view crs - note - this only works with the raster package loaded
crs(point_HARV)
```

```
## Error in crs(point_HARV): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```r
# view extent- note - this only works with the raster package loaded
extent(point_HARV)
```

```
## Error in extent(point_HARV): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```r
# view metadata summary
point_HARV
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

## About Shapefile Attributes
Shapefiles often contain an associated database or spreadsheet of values called
**attributes** that describe the vector features in the shapefile. You can think
of this like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each column in the spreadsheet
is an individual **attribute** that describes an object. Shapefile attributes
include measurements that correspond to the geometry of the shapefile features.

For example, the `HARV_Roads` shapefile (`lines_HARV` object) contains an
attribute called `TYPE`. Each line in the shapefile has an associated `TYPE` 
which describes the type of road (woods road, footpath, boardwalk, or 
stone wall).

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The shapefile format allows us to store attributes for each
    feature (vector object) stored in the shapefile. The attribute table, is 
    similar to a spreadsheet. There is a row for each feature. The first column
    contains the unique ID of the feature. We can add additional columns that
    describe the feature. Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network
    (NEON) 
    </figcaption>
</figure>

We can look at all of the associated data attributes by printing the contents of
the `data` slot with `objectName@data`. We can use the base `R` `length` 
function to count the number of attributes associated with a spatial object too.


```r
# just view the attributes & first 6 attribute values of the data
head(lines_HARV@data)
```

```
## Error in head(lines_HARV@data): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# how many attributes are in our vector data object?
length(lines_HARV@data)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

We can view the individual **name of each attribute** using the
`names(lines_HARV@data)` method in `R`. We could also view just the first 6 rows
of attribute values using  `head(lines_HARV@data)`. 

Let's give it a try.


```r
# view just the attribute names for the lines_HARV spatial object
names(lines_HARV@data)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Attributes for Different Spatial Classes
Explore the attributes associated with the `point_HARV` and `aoiBoundary_HARV` 
spatial objects. 

1. How many attributes do each have?
2. Who owns the site in the `point_HARV` data object?
3. Which of the following is NOT an attribute of the `point` data object?

    A) Latitude      B) County     C) Country
</div>


```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'aoiBoundary_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in head(point_HARV@data): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'point_HARV' not found
```

## Explore Values within One Attribute
We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
Again, comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a `data.frame`, this is similar
to exploring values in a column. We can do this using the `$` and the name of
the attribute: `objectName$attributeName`. 


```r
# view all attributes in the lines shapefile within the TYPE field
lines_HARV$TYPE
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# view unique values within the "TYPE" attributes
levels(lines_HARV@data$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV@data$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

Notice that two of our TYPE attribute values consist of two separate words: 
stone wall and woods road. There are really four unique TYPE values, not six 
TYPE values.  

### Subset Shapefiles
We can use the `objectName$attributeName` syntax to select a subset of features
from a spatial object in `R`. 


```r
# select features that are of TYPE "footpath"
# could put this code into other function to only have that function work on
# "footpath" lines
lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# save an object with only footpath lines
footpath_HARV <- lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
footpath_HARV
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'footpath_HARV' not found
```

```r
# how many features are in our new object
length(footpath_HARV)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'footpath_HARV' not found
```

Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count from 13 to 2. This means
that only two feature lines in our spatial object have the attribute
"TYPE=footpath".

We can plot our subsetted shapefiles.


```r
# plot just footpaths
plot(footpath_HARV,
     lwd=6,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths")
```

```
## Error in plot(footpath_HARV, lwd = 6, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths"): object 'footpath_HARV' not found
```

Interesting. Above, it appeared as if we had 2 features in our footpaths subset.
Why does the plot look like there is only one feature?

Let's adjust the colors used in our plot. If we have 2 features in our vector
object, we can plot each using a unique color by assigning unique colors (`col=`)
to our features. We use the syntax

`col="c("colorOne","colorTwo")`

to do this.


```r
# plot just footpaths
plot(footpath_HARV,
     col=c("green","blue"), # set color for each feature 
     lwd=6,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths \n Feature one = blue, Feature two= green")
```

```
## Error in plot(footpath_HARV, col = c("green", "blue"), lwd = 6, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Footpaths \n Feature one = blue, Feature two= green"): object 'footpath_HARV' not found
```

Now, we see that there are in fact two features in our plot! 


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Subset Spatial Line Objects
Subset out all:

1. `boardwalk` from the lines layer and plot it.
2. `stone wall` features from the lines layer and plot it. 

For each plot, color each feature using a unique color.
</div>


```

```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'boardwalk_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'boardwalk_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in plot(boardwalk_HARV, col = c("green"), lwd = 6, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Boardwalks\n Feature one = blue, Feature two= green"): object 'boardwalk_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'stoneWall_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'stoneWall_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in plot(stoneWall_HARV, col = c("green", "blue", "orange", "brown", : object 'stoneWall_HARV' not found
```

## Plot Lines by Attribute Value
To plot vector data with the color determined by a set of attribute values, the 
attribute values must be class = `factor`. A **factor** is similar to a category
- you can group vector objects by a particular category value - for example you 
can group all lines of `TYPE=footpath`. However, in `R`, a factor can also have 
a determined *order*. 

By default, `R` will import spatial object attributes as `factors`.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If our data attribute values are not 
read in as factors, we can convert the categorical 
attribute values using `as.factor()`.
{: .notice}


```r
# view the original class of the TYPE column
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# view levels or categories - note that there are no categories yet in our data!
# the attributes are just read as a list of character elements.
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# Convert the TYPE attribute into a factor
# Only do this IF the data do not import as a factor!
# lines_HARV$TYPE <- as.factor(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
# levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

# how many features are in each category or level?
summary(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in summary(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

When we use `plot()`, we can specify the colors to use for each attribute using
the `col=` element. To ensure that `R` renders each feature by it's associated 
factor / attribute value, we need to create a `vector` or colors - one for each 
feature, according to it's associated attribute value / `factor` value. 

To create this vector we can use the following syntax:

`c("colorOne", "colorTwo","colorThree")[object$factor]`

Note in the above example we have 

1. a vector of colors - one for each factor value (unique attribute value)
2. the attribute itself (`[object$factor]`) of class `factor`.

Let's give this a try.



```r
# Check the class of the attribute - is it a factor?
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# how many "levels" or unique values does hte factor have?
# view factor values
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# count the number of unique values or levels
length(levels(lines_HARV$TYPE))
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# create a color palette of 4 colors - one for each factor level
roadPalette <- c("blue","green","grey","purple")
roadPalette
```

```
## [1] "blue"   "green"  "grey"   "purple"
```

```r
# create a vector of colors - one for each feature in our vector object
# according to its attribute value
roadColors <- c("blue","green","grey","purple")[lines_HARV$TYPE]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
roadColors
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'roadColors' not found
```

```r
# plot the lines data, apply a diff color to each factor level)
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=roadColors,
     lwd=3,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails")
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, lwd = 3, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails"): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

### Adjust Line Width
We can also adjust the width of our plot lines using `lwd`. We can set all lines
to be thicker or thinner using `lwd=`. 


```r
# make all lines thicker
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=roadColors,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n All Lines Thickness=6",
     lwd=6)
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n All Lines Thickness=6", : object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

### Adjust Line Width by Attribute

If we want a unique line width for each factor level or attribute category
in our spatial object, we can use the same syntax that we used for colors, above.

`lwd=c("widthOne", "widthTwo","widthThree")[object$factor]`

Note that this requires the attribute to be of class `factor`. Let's give it a 
try.


```r
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# create vector of line widths
lineWidths <- (c(1,2,3,4))[lines_HARV$TYPE]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# adjust line width by level
# in this case, boardwalk (the first level) is the narrowest.
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=roadColors,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Line width varies by TYPE Attribute Value",
     lwd=lineWidths)
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Line width varies by TYPE Attribute Value", : object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Plot Line Width by Attribute 
We can customize the width of each line, according to specific attribute value,
too. To do this, we create a vector of line width values, and map that vector
to the factor levels - using the same syntax that we used above for colors.
HINT: `lwd=(vector of line width thicknesses)[spatialObject$factorAttribute]`

Create a plot of roads using the following line thicknesses:

1. woods road lwd=8
2. Boardwalks lwd = 2
3. footpath lwd=4
4. stone wall lwd=3
 
</div>


```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'lineWidth' not found
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Line width varies by Type Attribute Value", : object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Given we have a factor with 4 levels, 
we can create an vector of numbers, each of which specifies the thickness of each
feature in our `SpatialLinesDataFrame` by factor level (category): `c(6,4,1,2)[lines_HARV$TYPE]`
{: .notice}

## Add Plot Legend
We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we use the following
elements to specify labels and colors:

* `bottomright`: We specify the **location** of our legend by using a default 
keyword. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.
* `levels(objectName$attributeName)`: Label the **legend elements** using the
categories of `levels` in an attribute (e.g., levels(lines_HARV$TYPE) means use
the levels boardwalk, footpath, etc).
* `fill=`: apply unique **colors** to the boxes in our legend. `palette()` is 
the default set of colors that `R` applies to all plots. 

Let's add a legend to our plot.


```r
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=roadColors,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n Default Legend")
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails\n Default Legend"): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# we can use the color object that we created above to color the legend objects
roadPalette
```

```
## [1] "blue"   "green"  "grey"   "purple"
```

```r
# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright",   # location of legend
      legend=levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), # categories or elements to render in 
			 # the legend
      fill=roadPalette) # color palette to use to fill objects in legend.
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

We can tweak the appearance of our legend too.

* `bty=n`: turn off the legend BORDER
* `cex`: change the font size

Let's try it out.


```r
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=roadColors,
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Modified Legend")
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = roadColors, main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Modified Legend"): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", 
       legend=levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), 
       fill=roadPalette, 
       bty="n", # turn off the legend border
       cex=.8) # decrease the font / legend size
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

We can modify the colors used to plot our lines by creating a new color vector,
directly in the plot code too rather than creating a separate object.

`col=(newColors)[lines_HARV$TYPE]`

Let's try it!


```r
# manually set the colors for the plot!
newColors <- c("springgreen", "blue", "magenta", "orange")
newColors
```

```
## [1] "springgreen" "blue"        "magenta"     "orange"
```

```r
# plot using new colors
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=(newColors)[lines_HARV$TYPE],
     main="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Pretty Colors")
```

```
## Error in plot(lines_HARV, col = (newColors)[lines_HARV$TYPE], main = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \n Pretty Colors"): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

```r
# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", 
       levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), 
       fill=newColors, 
       bty="n", cex=.8)
```

```
## Error in levels(lines_HARV$TYPE): object 'lines_HARV' not found
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can modify the defaul R color palette 
using the palette method. For example `palette(rainbow(6))` or
`palette(terrain.colors(6))`. You can reset the palette colors using
`palette("default")`!

## Challenge: Plot Polygon by Attribute

1. Create a map of the State boundaries in the United States using the data
located in your downloaded data folder: `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers\US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014`. 
Apply a fill color to each state using its `region` value. Add a legend.

2. Using the `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/PlotLocations_HARV.shp` shapefile, 
create a map of study plot locations, with each point colored by the soil type
(`soilTypeOr`).  **Question:** How many different soil types are there at this particular field site? 

3. BONUS -- modify the field site plot above. Plot each point,
using a different symbol. HINT: you can assign the symbol using `pch=` value. 
You can create a vector object of symbols by factor level using the syntax
syntax that we used above to create a vector of lines widths and colors:
`pch=c(15,17)[lines_HARV$soilTypeOr]`. Type `?pch` to learn more about pch or 
use google to find a list of pch symbols that you can use in `R`.
