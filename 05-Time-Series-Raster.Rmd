##About
This lesson covers how to work with a raster time series, using an `R`
RasterStack object. It also covers practical assessment of data quality
in remote sensing derived imagery. Finally, it covers simple plotting of raster
time series.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

#About Raster Time Series Data
Raster Data Sets can be made up of multiple files or bands.  These could be
different specra taken at the same time and location that together offer a
more complete image of the location. Or these could be single bands taken at
different times of the same location.  Time series data gives us the ability to 
measure and monitor changes through time.

In this lesson, we are working with a set of rasters that were derived from the 
Landsat satellite and are stored in GeoTIFF format. Each raster covers part of
the  <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

In this lesson, we will

1. Import NDVI data derived from the Landsat Sensor in raster GeoTIFF format
2. Plot one full year of NDVI raster time series data. 
3. Compare RGB imagery with NDVI data to understand strange values in the NDVI. 

##NDVI data
The rasters that we will work with, located in the source folder
(`Landsat_NDVI\HARV\ndvi`), is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI). NDVI is a quantitative index of greenness ranging from 0-1 where 0 is 
the least amount of greenness and 1 is maximum greenness following 
the index. NDVI is often used for a quantative measure of vegetation health, 
cover and vegetation phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. 
The NDVI data is a derived single band product saved as a GeoTIFF for different
times of the year.

    <figcaption>NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light
    reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation (left) absorbs most of the
    visible light that hits it, and reflects a large portion of the
    near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation (right) reflects more
    visible light and less near-infrared light. Image & Caption Source: NASA </figcaption>

##RGB data
While the NDVI data is a single band product, the RGB images represent 3 (of the 
7) 30m resolution bands available on Landsat. The RGB directory contains RGB
images for each time period that NDVI is available.

##Getting Started 
In this lesson, we will use the `raster` and `rgdal` packages.

```{r load-libraries }

library(raster)
library(rgdal)

```

To begin, we will create a list of raster files that can be used to
generate a `RasterStack`. We can use `list.files()` to designate the list. We
will tell `R` to only find files with a `.tif` extention using the syntax
`pattern=".tif$"`.

If we specify `full.names=TRUE`, the full path for each file will be added to
the list. We will be able to create a `RasterStack` directly from the list.

```{r import-ndvi-rasters }

# Create list of NDVI file paths
 #assign path to object = cleaner code
NDVI_HARV_path <- "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi" 
all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(NDVI_HARV_path,
                            full.names = TRUE,
                            pattern = ".tif$")

#view list - note the full path, relative to our working directory, is included
all_NDVI_HARV

```

Now we have a list of all GeoTIFF files in the `ndvi` directory for Harvard
Forest. Once we have this list, we can create a stack and begin to work with the
data. 

```{r create-timeSeries-raster-stack }
# Create a time series raster stack
NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)
```

We can also explore the GeoTIFF tags (the embedded metadata) to learn more about
key metadata for our data including the Coordinate Reference System (`CRS`), 
`extent` and raster `resolution`.

``` {r explore-RasterStack-tags}
#view crs of rasters
crs(NDVI_HARV_stack)

#view extent of rasters in stack
extent(NDVI_HARV_stack)

#view the y resolution of our rasters
yres(NDVI_HARV_stack)

#view the x resolution of our rasters
xres(NDVI_HARV_stack)

```

#Challenge: Raster Metadata
Before going further, answer the following questions about our `RasterStack`.

1. What is the `CRS`?
2. What is the `resolution` of the data? And what `units` is that resolution in?

``` {r challenge-code-raster-metadata, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#1. UTM zone 19 WGS 84
#2. 30x30 meters

```

#Plotting Time Series Data
Once we have created our `RasterStack`, we can visualize our data. We can us
the `plot()` command to quickly plot a `RasterStack`.

```{r plot-time-series }

#view a plot of all of the rasters
#'nc' specifies number of columns (we will have 13 plots)
plot(NDVI_HARV_stack, 
     zlim = c(1500, 10000), 
     nc = 4)

```

Wait, NDVI data scale from 0-1, why is this data up to 10,000?  The metadata for this NDVI data have a scale factor: 10,000. A scale factor is
commonly used in larger datasets to remove decimals. Storing decimal places
actually consumes more space and creates larger file sizes compared to storing
integer values.

Note: We could make this plot (`levelplot`) even prettier by fixing the
individual tile names and adding an overall plot title. How to do this is
covered in the NEON Data Skills 
[Plot Time Series Rasters in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/Plot-Raster-Times-Series-Data-In-R/) 
lesson. {: .notice2}

##Taking a Closer Look at Our Data
Let's take a close look at the plots of our data. Given what you might know 
about the seasons in Massachusettes where the Harvard Forest is located, do you 
notice anything that seems unusual about the patterns of greening and browning 
of the vegetation at the site?  

Hint: the  number after the X in the tile title is the Julian day.  If you are
unfamiliar with Julian day, check out the NEON Data Skills 
[Converting to Julian Day ]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/julian-day-conversion/) 
lesson.

What is another way we can look at these data that is a bit more quantitative 
than viewing images? We could use histograms that show the frequency of pixels
that occur at each NDVI value.

```{r view-stack-histogram }

#create histograms of each image
hist(NDVI_HARV_stack, 
     xlim = c(0, 10000))

```

It seems like things get green in the spring and summer like we expect, but the 
data at Julian days 277 and 293 are unusual. It appears as if the vegetation got
green in the spring, but then died back only to get green again towards the end of the year. Is this right?

###Exploring Unusual Data Patterns
The NDVI data that we are using comes from 2011, perhaps a strong freeze around
Julian day 277 could cause a major plant die off. 

```{r view-temp-data, echo=FALSE }

library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
harMetDaily <- read.csv("AtmosData/HARV/hf001-06-daily-m.csv",
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#set the field to be a date field
harMetDaily$date <- as.Date(harMetDaily$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

#subset out some of the data - 2010-2013 
yr.09.11_dailyAvg <- subset(harMetDaily, date >= as.Date('2011-01-01') & date <=
as.Date('2012-01-01'))

#plot Air Temperature Data (airt) by julian day (jd)
  
myPlot <- ggplot(yr.09.11_dailyAvg,aes(jd, airt)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle("2011 Air Temperature\nHarvard Forest") +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold",size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=20)) +
           xlab("Julian Day") + ylab("Mean Air Temperature")

myPlot

```

There are no significant peaks or dips in the temperature during the late summer
or early fall time period that could logically cause cause the vegetation to
brown (around day 277) and then quickly green again (by day 309). 

What is happening here? 

The temperature data suggests that the pattern of warming and cooling is fairly
consistent. Maybe we should look at the 3-band RGB imagery to see what that
looks like. 

#Challenge: Examine RGB Raster Files
Load the RGB imagery located in the `RGB` directory. Plot the RGB images.
Identify the plots for the Julian days 277 and 293.  Does viewing the RGB
imagery from these two days help explain the NDVI data?  

```{r view-all-rgb, echo=FALSE}
#open up the cropped files
#create list of files to make raster stack
RGB_HARV_allCropped <-  list.files("Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/", 
                              full.names=TRUE, 
                              pattern = ".tif$")

#create a layout
par(mfrow=c(4,4))

#Super efficient code
for (aFile in RGB_HARV_allCropped){
  ndvi.rastStack <- stack(aFile)
  plotRGB(ndvi.rastStack, stretch="lin")
}

#code parrallel to what was previously taught in lesson
#RGB_NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(RGB_HARV_allCropped)
#plotRGB(RGB_HARV_NDVIstack,
     #r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
     #stretch ="lin")

#reset layout
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```
