 * OVERALL GOALS or list for each lesson? 


##Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson

###Setup RStudio
To complete the tutorial series you will need an updated version of R and,
 preferably, RStudio installed on your computer.
 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is a programming language
 that specializes in statistical computing. It is a powerful tool for
 exploratory data analysis. To interact with R, we strongly recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive development 
environment (IDE). 


###Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary R Packages now. 

* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`
* **sp:** `install.packages("sp")`
* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **ggplot2:** `install.packages("ggplot2")`
