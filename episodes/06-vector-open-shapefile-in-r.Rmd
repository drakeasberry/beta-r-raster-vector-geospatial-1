In this tutorial, we will open and plot point, line and polygon vector data
stored in shapefile format in `R`.

## About Vector Data
Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization
of the vertices, determines the type of vector that we are working
with: point, line or polygon.

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or
    polygons. Each object type has a different structure.

</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and
"closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or
countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a
hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but
not an issue we will deal with in this tutorial.

> ## Data Tip
> Sometimes, boundary layers such as
>  states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these
> boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format.
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in `R`. Notice that the
`rgdal` package automatically loads when `sf` is loaded. We will also load the
`raster` package so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.

```{r load-libraries }
# load required libraries
# for vector work
library(sf)
# for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library(raster)

# set working directory to the directory location on your computer where
# you downloaded and unzipped the data files for the tutorial
# setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a>
located at the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
shapefiles we use the `sf` function `st_read`.

`st_read()` requires the file path to the shapefile.

Let's import our AOI.

```{r Import-Shapefile}
# Import a polygon shapefile
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read(
  "data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
```

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into `R` (as our
`aoi_boundary_HARV` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

> ## Data Tip
> The [Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/)
> tutorial provides more information on both metadata and attributes
> and using attributes to subset and plot data.
{: .callout}

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `st_geometry_type`, `st_crs` and `st_bbox` methods:

```{r view-metadata}
# view just the geometry type for the shapefile
st_geometry_type(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view just the crs for the shapefile
st_crs(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view just the extent for the shapefile
st_bbox(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view all metadata at same time
aoi_boundary_HARV
```

Our `aoi_boundary_HARV` is an `sf` polygon object,
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object
`extent` values as it specifies units.

    <figcaption>The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents
    the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and
    west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.

</figure>


We can view the attributes of an `sf` object by printing it to the screen. The geometry of the object can be dropped by turning the object into a `data.frame`.

``` {r Shapefile-attributes-2}
aoi_boundary_HARV

# alternate way to view attributes
data.frame(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering
the name of the `R` object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **geometry type**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the `R` object. The output of `summary()` shows a preview of the `R` object **attributes**.

```{r shapefile-summary}
# view a summary of metadata & attributes associated with the spatial object
summary(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```


# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using
`plot()`.

``` {r plot-shapefile}
# create a plot of the shapefile
# 'lwd' sets the line width
# 'col' sets internal color
# 'border' sets line color
plot(aoi_boundary_HARV, col = "cyan1", border = "black", lwd = 3,
     main = "AOI Boundary Plot")

```

## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
The `plot()` function can be used for basic plotting of spatial objects.
We use the `add = TRUE` argument to overlay shapefiles on top of each other, as
we would when creating a map in a typical GIS application like QGIS.

We can use `main = ""` to give our plot a title. If we want the title to span two
lines, we use `\n` where the line should break.

```{r plot-multiple-shapefiles}
# Plot multiple shapefiles
plot(aoi_boundary_HARV, col = "lightgreen",
     main = "NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
plot(lines_HARV, add = TRUE)

# use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
plot(point_HARV, add  = TRUE, pch = 19, col = "purple")
```

> ## Data Tip
> The pch argument specifies the point shape. A list of valid point shapes can be found by viewing
