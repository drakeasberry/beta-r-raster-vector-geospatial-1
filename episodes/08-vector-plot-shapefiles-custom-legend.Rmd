This episode builds upon
[the previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r/)
to work with shapefile attributes in `R` and explores how to plot multiple
shapefiles using base R graphics.

## Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `sf` library. The `raster`
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
raster and vector files. Make sure that you have these libraries loaded.

We will continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode.

## Plotting Multiple Shapefiles
In the [previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/),
we learned how to plot information from a single shapefile and do
some plot customization including adding a basic legend.

However, what if we want to create a more complex plot with many shapefiles
and unique symbols that need to be represented clearly in a legend?

Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`),
site boundary (`aoi_boundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. We
will need to build a custom legend as well.

To begin, we will create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. Then layer
the tower location and road data on top using `+`.

```{r plot-many-shapefiles }
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Next, let's build a custom legend using the symbology (the colors and symbols)
that we used to create the plot above. For example, it might be good if the lines were symbolized as lines.

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black") +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Now lets adjust the legend titles by passing a `name` to the respective `color` and `fill` palettes.

```{r create-custom-legend}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type)) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette, name = "Line Type") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location") + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Finally, it might be better if the points were symbolized as a symbol. We can customize this using `shape` parameters in our call to `geom_sf`: 16 is a point symbol, 15 is a box.

```{r custom-symbols}
ggplot() +
 geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
 geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), shape = 15) +
 geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") +
 scale_color_manual(values = road_palette, name = "Line Type") +
 scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location") +
 ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```
